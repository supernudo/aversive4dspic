/*
 *  -- INFO --
 *	This module enable the use of the SPI hardware
 *	on some PICs. For now, only MASTER mode is available.
 *	You can have as many slaves as you want, as long as you
 *	don't confuse them by trying to speak to several at the same time.
 *
 *      BIG WARNING: If you use /SS as a slave selector, always
 *      register it using spi_register_ss_line() *before* calling
 *      spi_init(). Read carrefully the datasheet, especially the
 *      paragraph "SS Pin Functionnality" in SPI section. In master
 *      mode, the SS pin must be configured as an output OR driven
 *      high by an external circuitry.
 *
 *  -- USAGE --
 *	So you have one (or several) device(s) that want to speak to your
 *	shiny PIC over SPI ?
 *	This is fairly easy. First, summon this module with spi_init().
 *	You can configure
 *	 - the FORMAT of the link (sample on rising or falling edge, ...)
 *	 - the RATE of the connection (you set the prescaler dividing the CPU clock)
 *
 *	After that you can register your devices using spi_register_ss_line();
 *	This returns you a device identifier you can use with spi_slave_[de]select();
 *
 *	Remember to ALWAYS select your slave before talking to it, and deselect if
 *	once your are done.
